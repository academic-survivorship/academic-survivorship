# Welcome 
Welcome to the IB 305: Thriving in Academia course website! 

### Course description
This course prepares students for a successful start to a PhD, with a series of discussions and workshops led by two faculty and an experienced GSI. The course focuses on helping students integrate into their PhD program, and each week starts with a 10 min discussion on common issues encountered by early PhD students. The first half of the course focuses on scientific writing skills, and is timed to coincide with the NSF GRFP program deadline. Topics covered are developing a research idea, constructing a linear flow of logic, effective literature searching, developing a research plan, effective use of figures and displays, the art of scientific writing, broader impacts, and writing personal statements (the latter session is only for GRFP applicants, all other sessions are generally aimed at all students). The second half of the course covers other topics central to the early years of the PhD program, including building a professional network, mentoring, CVs, publishing, academic and non-academic careers, and other topics.
